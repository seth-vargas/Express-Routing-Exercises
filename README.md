# Express-Routing-Exercises
## Todos
- [x] setup npm env
- [x] install express
- [x] require express
- [x] instantiate app
- [x] set up get request for /mean (average)
- [x] set up get request for /median (midpoint)
- [x] set up get request for /mode (most frequent)
- [x] return json for /mean
- [x] return json for /median
- [x] return json for /mode
- [x] handle NaN errors. For instance, /mean?nums=foo,2,3 should respond with a 400 Bad Request status code and a response that saying something like: foo is not a number.
- [x] handle empty input: /mean without passing any nums should respond with a 400 Bad Request status code saying something like nums are required.
- [ ] make sure you have unit tests for mean, median and mode.
